                Welcome to our web app for boxers and coaches looking for cross gym sparring opportunities! 
                Our platform is designed to connect boxers with gyms that offer sparring sessions with athletes from other training facilities.
                <hr>
                Coaches can create events and manage their gym's information on our platform, including gym location, hours of operation, 
                and contact information. Boxers can search for sparring events based on their location, preferred date and time, and skill level.
                <hr>
                Our user-friendly interface makes it easy for both coaches and boxers to navigate and find the information they need. 
                Coaches can also communicate with boxers who have expressed interest in their events to confirm details and answer any questions.
                <hr>
                We prioritize safety and sportsmanship in all of our events, and we encourage all participants to 
                respect each other's skill levels and abilities. We believe that cross gym sparring is an excellent way for boxers to improve their 
                skills and gain experience, and we are committed to providing a platform that makes it easy to find and participate in these events.
                <hr>

                I created this web app to make it easier for boxers and coaches to find cross gym sparring opportunities and connect with other 
                athletes and training facilities since I was having trouble finding sparring partners in other gyms. As many people using this 
                website, I am a fellow amateur boxer and software dev.
